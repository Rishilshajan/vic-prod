            content: "The Integrated Farming Cluster (IFC) is a programme initiated by the NRLM, launched by the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) and supported by the NRETP, aimed to strengthen rural livelihoods through—Collectivisation, Product Identification, Training & Capacity Building, Establishment of Livelihood Service Centre (LSC) and Market Linkages. Funded by NRETP, the project spanned from 2020 to 2023, reaching over 62,000 households across 10 states. RCRC in partnership with the Ministry of Rural Development, implemented the programme across 10 states through multiple CSOs. The IFC includes: Crop Production (field crops, horticulture, plantations), Livestock (dairy, poultry, goat rearing, etc.), Apiculture (beekeeping), NTFP-based livelihoods. VIC visited GTA (Gorkhaland Territorial Administration) in West Bengal and interacted with members of the CLF and the CSO partner to understand and witness the beneficiaries' growth and experience in the IFC programme."

            content: "The IFC programme has transformed the lives and livelihoods of all unit members. It has revitalised their farming practices, increased their accessibility to inputs and tools, increased their technical knowledge and understanding of cultivating crops and other livelihood practices, and provided them with opportunities for market linkages. Our on-ground visits revealed the following benefits reaped from the programme: Enhanced Technical Skills: Farmers reported having learnt modern techniques for growing seasonal crops, practising organic farming, and using modern farming machinery. Increased Yields: Crop productivity was reported to have significantly increased. Previously, a farmer could produce 50 kg of seasonal crops, but now they can yield as much as 250 kg, as reported by a member of the CLF. The average farm size in the region is 0.6-0.8 acre. Income Gain: On average, it estimated that there is a 20-50% increase in household income due to reduced input costs, higher yields, and better market access. One of the beneficiaries shared that growing cucumbers through machan cultivation instead of traditional methods, has increased her income to ₹1 lakh from ₹60,000— about a 66% increase. Additionally, cucumbers grown using machan techniques were larger in size compared to those produced using traditional methods, illustrating better-quality yields. Improved Market Access: With newfound knowledge of market linkages, the women farmers have eliminated middlemen. Women farmers reported, instead of selling for ₹10 to intermediaries, they now earn ₹30–₹40 per unit by selling directly through Producer Groups. Improved Awareness: Farmers stated they now understand the roles of support organisations like Rajarhat Prasari, CRPs, CLFs, and relevant government departments. They know where to seek help and how to navigate available services. Stronger Relationships with Government Officials: Personal rapport and regular engagement have fostered mutual trust between women farmers and government officials, enabling smoother access to schemes and support."

            heading: "Sustainable Impact",
            content: "Behaviour, Attitude & Perceptions: There has been a shift in mindset—from farming for survival to treating agriculture as a viable, income-generating enterprise. With increased confidence, farmers now see themselves as agents of their own economic progress. Future Aspirations: Beneficiaries are planning ahead by leveraging local resources and market opportunities, with many investing in small agri-businesses like seed production and value-added processing to build sustainable livelihoods."

            heading: "On ground story",
            content: "During our field visit to a CLF in West Bengal, we interacted with members who are actively working to diversify their income by leveraging the region's abundant bamboo resources. They plan to manufacture and sell broomsticks and have already procured the necessary machinery. To expand demand, they are exploring partnerships with government departments and local schools that regularly purchase such items. Inspiring Wider Community: Successful farmers have become role models, inspiring others to adopt improved practices. There are community-led training sessions where experienced farmers mentor peers, fostering collective growth."
